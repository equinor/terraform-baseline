# Equinor Terraform Baseline

Equinor Terraform Baseline (ETB) is:

- A set of best practices for creating reusable Terraform modules using the Azure provider.
- A library of reusable Terraform modules that have been created using these best practices.

ETB is currently written as an extension of [Terraform Best Practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com), however the long-term goal is for ETB to be a complete replacement.

Before using ETB, you should be familiar with the following pages from the official Terraform documentation:

- [Standard Module Structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure)
- [Version Constraints](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints)
- [Publishing Modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/modules/publish)
