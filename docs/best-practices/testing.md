# Testing

- Automated tests should be implemented for all variants of the relevant resource using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/). For example, in the `storage` module, automated tests should be implemented for standard GPv2 storage, premium GPv2 storage, standard blob storage, premium block blob storage and premium file storage.
